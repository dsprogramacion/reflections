—> What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I think is important to make a repository so you can keep in record all the changes made on the files and upload them together making sure everything works well! When you initialize a repository you create a few files that will store all the info needed for the history, etc.!

—> How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is the place for temporal work, where we put all the dirty work and decide what to do with it before the commit, it offers a great value so we can manage the files previous to their commit

—> How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change? 

If you compare the changes of the working directory files and the staging area ones before making a commit, you can see if the changes made were enough to make a new commit

—> What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When u want to create different versions in the master without changing the original code git helps you by creating another branch and making the changes only on it!
