—> What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I think is important to make a repository so you can keep in record all the changes made on the files and upload them together making sure everything works well! When you initialize a repository you create a few files that will store all the info needed for the history, etc.!

—> How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is the place for temporal work, where we put all the dirty work and decide what to do with it before the commit, it offers a great value so we can manage the files previous to their commit
